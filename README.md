# padawans
A padawan: referred to a Force-sensitive adolescent who trained in the Jedi Order to one day become a Jedi.

In this case of blind leading the blind, we are looking to explore different coding problems/challenges to one day ascend to a knight. 
Using any programming language of the padwan's choice, the idea is to solve the challenges in the most innovative way possible. One way to choose would be to benchmark and choose to fastest. Another way would be to choose the one easiet to read (Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. - Leonardo da Vinci)
Once exposed to multiple languages through challenges, choose a winner or two and use that language to develop a sweet group project (ideas pending).
